# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
I was tasked with examining PyBer Rideshare data for January through April of 2019 specifically examining ridership and fares by city type (rural, suburban and urban). For each city type, I calculated total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fares and average fare per driver to get an overall sense of where PyBer business is coming from and to offer suggestions of how to proceed in the future. 

## Results of Analysis
### PyBer Ridership Summary Snapshot
In examining the PyBer Ridership data, I was able to get a really good sense of where PyBer business seems to come from and where they can expand their market to generate even more fares. Let me breakdown the details by city type.

#### Urban PyBer Rides
In looking at this overall summary, it's easy to see that majority of the PyBer fares and rides are coming from the Urban city type, with almost $40,000 in total fares and 68.4% (1625 total) of rides. There is definitely a high demand for PyBer business in the urban areas. With that said, there is also a high amount of drivers in Urban areas as well, with 59602 total drivers at 86.7% of the total driver count. With such a high amount of drivers, the average fare per driver is smallest amount, at $.67. Additionally, the average fare is the lowest of the three city types, coming in at $24.53 per fare. 

#### Suburban PyBer Rides
The suburban ridership of PyBer is not to be ignored. With 625 rides, which is 26.3% of the total ridership and 8570 total drivers, there is definitely a demand for PyBer in suburban areas. With total fares at $19.356.33, Suburban riders make up 30.5% of PyBer Ridership. Another thing to note is that there are fewer Suburban PyBer drivers which provides them with a higher fare than Urban drivers, coming in at $30.97 per fare, with the Average fare per driver at $2.26.

#### Rural PyBer Rides
The rural ridership of PyBer is a lot smaller than the other two city types. With only 125 total rides, which is of 5.3% of total ridership, there seems to be less of a demand for rides in the rural areas. In that same vein, there are less Rural PyBer drivers at 537 total drivers which is only 0.08% of total drivers. With that said, the average fare is the highest of the three city types, coming in at $34.62 per fare. Additionally, the rural drivers make the most on average with $8.06.

#### Total Fare by City Type
The image below shows a clear view of the difference in total fares over the timeframe. The ridership seems to stay relatively consistent over the months with a minor spike around late February and a few throughout March and April. What is really shows is that the urban city type does the most in fares over the other two city types.

## Summary of Analysis
In analyzing this data, I have three business recommendations for you.

### Encourage urban drivers to expand their routes
As you can see from the data, though there is a large amount of urban riders, there is also a large amount of urban drivers. I would recommend that you work on a campaign to encourage urban drivers to expand their routes outside of the urban area. This will give them the opportunity to make a bit more money and help meet the demand in the suburban and rural areas. 

### Market to rural areas
The rural ridership is small. It might be less of a demand or it might be because there are less drivers. If you started a small marketing campaign to drum up rural business, it would get the PyBer name out there. If the rural ridership grows, it will most likely drive rural drivership or expand the drivers in the other city types to expand their routes. 

### Bump up the PyBer marketing around the holidays
The most surprising bit of data I discovered is that early January seems to have the lowest amount of ridership over that time frame. I would assume that with New Year celebrations, that the ridership would be up but looking at the trend in fares, that is actually one of the lowest fares for the city. I would further examine if the drivership is down. It could be that your drivers are out celebrating and offering less rides. Either way, a marketing campaign to generate riders and drivers around the beginning of the year would definitely offer a bump in fares. 

My overall analysis is that PyBer is doing great overall, but with my three suggestions above, you can definitely expand your PyBer business.
